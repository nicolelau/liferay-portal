## Generated Files
##

	#
	# For the most part, these are artifacts of our installation and
	# build processes and exist only as untracked files. A small number
	# are committed to the repository, but as they are generated files
	# the linter should not touch them.
	#
	*.soy.js

	classes/**

## Template Files
##

	#
	# This file defines the copyright headers the linter should add
	# to any file that does not have them. In order to produce the
	# desired result when prepended, it must have a trailing blank
	# line. Prettier would remove the blank line if we did not ignore it
	# here.
	#
	/copyright.js

##
## Sample Files
##

	#
	# These files are empty, apart from copyright headers, which means
	# that we need to ignore them to prevent Prettier from stripping off
	# the trailing blank line.
